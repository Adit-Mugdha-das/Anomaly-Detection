# Anomaly Detection 

This assignment applies anomaly detection using the Gaussian distribution to identify rare or abnormal examples in a dataset.  
It is part of **Week 1 (Course 3: Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning)** from the **Machine Learning Specialization** by **Andrew Ng** on Coursera.

##  Description

In this lab, I implemented a statistical anomaly detection system using the multivariate Gaussian distribution. The goal is to detect outliers in datasets by modeling the data distribution and flagging data points with low probability under the learned model.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- Unsupervised anomaly detection
- Gaussian probability density function (PDF)
- Feature selection for anomaly detection
- Estimating parameters (mean and variance)
- Threshold tuning using F1 score
- Precision-Recall tradeoffs for rare events

##  Files Included

- `anomaly_detection_lab.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with full implementation and evaluation
- `lab_utils_anomaly.py`: Helper functions for loading data and computing metrics
- `data/`: Contains synthetic datasets for anomaly detection training and validation

> ⚠️ This repository contains only my own implementation and complies with Coursera’s Honor Code.

##  Tools Used

- Python 3
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
